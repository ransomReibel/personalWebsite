        <p>Throughout my career I have specialized in interdisciplinary research and development for several emerging technologies.
          Among them is the successful deployment of multiple FMCW Lidar imaging systems for military and self driving car applications (data rendering pictured above). 
          The color schema illustrates the Doppler Effect, with blue representing material approaching the sensor and red being receding.  </p>
          <p>Addionally I have extensive experience in design for manufacture, as well as specialized industrial automation challenges. I'm always open to consulting on the right project, see my contact page for inquiries.</p>
